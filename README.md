## 📊 Mathematical Formulas (from PDF)

### Position Sizing

```
marginUsed = accountBalance × (positionPercent / 100)
positionValueUSD = marginUsed × leverage
size = floor(positionValueUSD / (entryPrice × multiplier))
```

**Example:**
- Account: $10,000
- Position: 0.5%
- Leverage: 10x
- Entry: $50,000

```
marginUsed = $10,000 × 0.005 = $50
positionValue = $50 × 10 = $500
size = floor($500 / $50,000) = 0.01 BTC
```

### P&L Calculation

```
priceDiff = currentPrice - entryPrice  (for longs)
unrealizedPnl = priceDiff × size × multiplier
leveragedPnlPercent = (unrealizedPnl / marginUsed) × 100
```

**Key Insight:** A 0.2% price move at 10x leverage = 2% ROI on margin.

### ROI-Based Stop-Loss & Take-Profit (V3.4.1+)

The stop-loss and take-profit are defined by target ROI percentages, not raw price percentages:

```
SL_price = entry × (1 - (R_risk / leverage / 100))
TP_price = entry × (1 + (R_reward / leverage / 100))
```

**Example at 10x leverage:**
- Target SL ROI: 0.5%
- Required price move: 0.5% ÷ 10 = 0.05%
- Entry $50,000 → SL at $49,975

### Fee-Adjusted Break-Even (V3.5)

```
breakEvenROI = (entryFee + exitFee) × leverage × 100 + buffer
```

**Example:**
- Taker fee: 0.06%
- Leverage: 10x
- Buffer: 0.1%

```
breakEvenROI = (0.0006 + 0.0006) × 10 × 100 + 0.1 = 1.3% ROI
```

The stop only moves to entry when leveraged ROI exceeds 1.3%, ensuring fees are covered.

### Liquidation Price

```
liqPrice = entry × (1 - (1 / leverage) × (1 + maintMargin))  // for longs
liqPrice = entry × (1 + (1 / leverage) × (1 + maintMargin))  // for shorts
```

**Example:**
- Long entry: $10,000
- Leverage: 10x
- Maintenance margin: 0.5%

```
liqPrice = $10,000 × (1 - 0.1 × 1.005) = $8,995
```

### Trailing Stop Algorithm (Staircase Mode)

```
steps = floor((currentROI - lastTrailedROI) / stepPercent)
if steps > 0:
    slMovePercent = steps × movePercent
    newSL = currentSL × (1 + slMovePercent / 100)  // for longs
```

**Configuration:**
- `TRAILING_STEP_PERCENT`: 0.15% ROI (trail every 0.15% profit)
- `TRAILING_MOVE_PERCENT`: 0.05% price (move SL by 0.05% per step)

### Slippage Buffer

```
adjustedStopPrice = stopPrice × (1 - slippageBuffer / 100)  // for long stops
adjustedStopPrice = stopPrice × (1 + slippageBuffer / 100)  // for short stops
```

Default buffer: 0.02% of price

## 🎛️ Configuration

### Trading Parameters

Edit `CONFIG.TRADING` in `server.js`:

```javascript
TRADING: {
  INITIAL_SL_ROI: 0.5,           // 0.5% ROI stop loss
  INITIAL_TP_ROI: 2.0,           // 2.0% ROI take profit
  BREAK_EVEN_BUFFER: 0.1,        // 0.1% buffer above fee break-even
  TRAILING_STEP_PERCENT: 0.15,   // Trail every 0.15% ROI gain
  TRAILING_MOVE_PERCENT: 0.05,   // Move SL by 0.05% price per step
  SLIPPAGE_BUFFER_PERCENT: 0.02, // 0.02% slippage buffer
  POSITION_SIZE_PERCENT: 0.5,    // 0.5% of balance per trade
  DEFAULT_LEVERAGE: 10,
  MAX_POSITIONS: 5
}
```

### Fee Configuration

```javascript
TAKER_FEE: 0.0006,  // 0.06% taker fee
MAKER_FEE: 0.0002,  // 0.02% maker fee
```

### Auto-Leverage Tiers

| ATR % | Safe Leverage |
|-------|---------------|
| < 0.5% | 50x |
| 0.5-1.0% | 25x |
| 1.0-2.0% | 15x |
| 2.0-3.0% | 10x |
| 3.0-5.0% | 5x |
| > 5.0% | 3x |

## 🔄 Trailing Stop Modes

### 1. Staircase (Default)
Discrete steps based on ROI increments. Most predictable behavior.

### 2. ATR-Based
Dynamic trailing distance based on Average True Range:
```
trailingDistance = ATR × 1.5
```
Adapts to market volatility automatically.

### 3. Dynamic
Variable step sizes based on profit level:
- < 5% ROI: 0.10% steps, 0.03% moves
- 5-20% ROI: 0.15% steps, 0.05% moves
- > 20% ROI: 0.25% steps, 0.10% moves

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### API Retry Queue
- Failed stop-loss updates are queued and retried
- Exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s
- Queue persisted to disk for crash recovery
- User notified of failed critical operations

### Reduce-Only Orders
All exit orders use `reduceOnly: true` to prevent accidental position reversal.

### Rate Limit Handling
- 5-second cooldown on rate limit errors
- Automatic retry with backoff
